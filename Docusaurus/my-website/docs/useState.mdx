# Exploring useState in React

In React, the `useState()` hook lets you create and manage state inside a function component.

When you call `const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);`, you're:
- Creating a piece of state called `count`
- Starting it at `0`
- Creating a function called `setCount` that updates the value of `count`

Try editing the example below to better understand how it works:

```jsx live
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times.</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
